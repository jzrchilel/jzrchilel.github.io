      Hi, I’m Jezer, a Software Developer currently living in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
      Part of <a href="https://www.epam.com/">Epam Systems</a> team.

    <p>
      I started to coding when I was in college. 
      I still remeber my first System.out.println("Hello world"); in Java, 
      since then I have tried to learn everthing that I could. 
      I have developed from Android and iOS apps to arduino cards. 
      I started to codign with Java, then moved to PHP and now 
      I have a focus in JavaScript and some of its frameworks and libraries. 
      For the past 3 years I've been developing frontend with React and Redux, 
      but also in the backend side with Node(Express).
    </p>
    <p>
      I speak Spanish and English. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, reading books, 
      watching movies with my wife and exploring new places with her.
    </p>
